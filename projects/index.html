    <p>A few highlights from my personal projects. You can also find the full list of repositories
         <a href  ="https://github.com/Jswig/Project-Portfolio"> here </a> on Github.
    Several of the Kaggle competitons were done in collaboration with other members of Data Science Slugs.
    </p>

    <h3> LANL Earthquake Prediction </h3>
    <p><a href = "https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-earthquakes">code</a></p>

    <p>My first Kaggle competition, in which I use stacked models (random forests, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbors) to predict earthquakes, 
     in the top ~5%. A few optimizations enabled me to do all of the training on my laptop. Technologies used include scikit-learn and pandas.
    </p>

    <h3> Understanding Clouds from Satellite Data</h3>
    <p><a href = "https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-cloudclassification/tree/anders-testing">code</a></p>

    <p> Kaggle competition in which I classified clouds on satellite images using a U-net implemented in TensorFlow. Used
    customized optimizers and data augmentation to boost performance, deploying training on a combination of cloud VMs and HPC clusters.
    Technologies used include TensorFlow witht the Keras frontend, pandas and Tensorboard for model debugging. Google Cloud Compute platform was 
    used to supplement the university's compute cluster.

    <h3> Who is Satoshi?</h3>
    <p><a href = "https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/textmining.R" >code</a> | <a href = "https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/CRWN88_HW3.pdf" >write-up</a></p>

    <p> Open-ended class project where I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.
    </p>


    <h3> Kannada MNIST </h3>
    <p><a href = "https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-kannada/blob/master/notebooks/0.1-apoirel-cnntest.ipynb">write-up</a></p>

    <p> Variation of the classical MNIST dataset using the Kannada script, with a added difficulty of having to predict on a validation set that is significantly different
    from the training set. Used a CNN architecture to achieve this improved performance, boosting the accuracy on the validation set from 0.5 too 0.75.
