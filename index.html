        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p> I am a third-year undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, working towards a double major in computer 
            science and mathematics.
            My main interests reside in machine learning, Bayesian statistics and numerical optimization. 

            Outside of class, I am the vice-president of Data Science Slugs, a campus organization seeking 
            to prepare students for a career in data science, where I lead coding workshops and work on Kaggle
            competitions.
        </p>
