        I am a third-year undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, working towards a  double major in computer science and computational mathematics.
        My main interests include machine learning, Bayesian statistics and numerical optimization. 
        Outside of class, I am the vice-president of Data Science Slugs, a campus organization seeking  to prepare students for a career in data science, where I lead coding workshops and work on Kaggle competitions.
