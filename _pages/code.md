| --- | --- | ---|
| [The Transparency Project](https://github.com/Jswig/dss-cruzhacks)| 1st place winner of the Cruzhacks 2020 hackathon at UC Santa Cruz, in which we scapped data on politcal ad spending and social media presence and presented it in a slick dashboard interface to give a transparent view of the power of money in politics. Live at [transparencyproject.tech](http://transparencyproject.tech/candidate_dashboard)| Javascript (Bootstrap), Python (flask, pandas, plotly, dash) |
| [DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-diseasespread)| (WIP) Predicting the number of dengue cases in two cities using gradient boosting and time-series based approaches. Currently in the top 7%| Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, prophet) |
| [LANL Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-earthquakes) | My first Kaggle competition, in which I use stacked models (random forests, SVMs and KNN) to predict earthquakes, finishing in the top ~5%. |  Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) |
| [Cookiecutter - Flexible ML](https://github.com/Jswig/cookiecutter-flexible-ml) | A flexible  [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) template for machine learning/data analysis projects | Python (cookiecutter, jinja2) | 
| [scikit-learn-progestimator](https://github.com/Jswig/sklearn-progestimator)| Scikit-learn estimator wrapper to facilitate prediction in time series problems where previous predictions are used as 
features | Python (scikit-learn, standard packaging tools)|
| [Predicting ratings from Reviews](https://github.com/Jswig/cse142-final-project)| Final project in which I implemented a LSTM model in TensorFlow  to predict star ratings from Yelp reviews| Python (TensorFlow, pandas) |
| [Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-cloudclassification/tree/anders-testing) | (On Hold until I get access to a better GPU setup) A Kaggle competition we used a U-net architecture to perform image segmentation| Python (TensorFlow, pandas), Google Cloud
| [Detecting Phones](https://github.com/Jswig/bctakehome)| Computer vision project I used to learn OpenCV in which I implemented an algorithm that detects phones on floors| Python (OpenCV)
| [Gridcast](https://github.com/Jswig/lahacks)| Entry for LA Hacks 2020, a web app implementing a live forecastng model of traffic accidents in the LA area and a vehicle routing algorithm avoiding hotspots of danger. | Python (flask, prophet, pandas, dash), Javascript, Mapbox
| [Who is Satoshi?](https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/CRWN88_HW3.pdf) | Open-ended class project where I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto | R (tm)
