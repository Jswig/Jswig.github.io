I study computer science and mathematics at UC Santa Cruz. My current interests include optimization, machine learning and  bayesian statistics.
I contributed to an early-stage fintech startup throughout Winter 2020. In April 2020, I joined [Startup Genome](https://startupgenome.com/) as a data science intern.
