#### bio

I am currently a data scientist at [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/), which is working to make electified 
air transport accessible to all.
Before that, I was a data scientist intern at [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/home/business). I also 
did research on generative models for genotypes at the [UCSC Genomics Institute](https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), 
and on the uses of container technology for improving reproducibility of research in the computational sciences at the 
[Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu/).
