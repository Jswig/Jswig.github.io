#### bio

I study computer science and mathematics at UC Santa Cruz. My current interests 
include data science, Python and Bayesian statistics. 
In April 2020, I joined [Startup Genome](https://startupgenome.com/) as a 
data science intern, where I worked on the analysis of survey data.
Throughout Summer 2020, I was a research intern at the 
[Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu/), where 
I contributed to tools facilitating reproducibility in the computational sciences. 
In October 2020, I joined the [UCSC Genomics Institute](https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/) 
to contribute to research on generating synthetic genomic data.
I joined [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/home/business)
 as a data scientist intern this January.
