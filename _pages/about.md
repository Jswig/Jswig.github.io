I study computer science and mathematics at UC Santa Cruz. My current interests include data science, bayesian statistics and Python open source projects.
I contributed to an early-stage fintech startup throughout winter 2020. In April 2020, I joined [Startup Genome](https://startupgenome.com/) as a data science intern.
