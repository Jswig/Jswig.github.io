I study computer science and mathematics at UC Santa Cruz. My current interests include optimization, machine learning and  bayesian statistics.
I've been working since December 2019 as a developer at an early-stage fintech startup.

Outside of work, I enjoy martial arts, strategy games and reading (or sometimes writing) short fiction and philosophy.
